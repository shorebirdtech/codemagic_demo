# codemagic_demo

A Flutter app demonstrating how to use [Codemagic](https://codemagic.io/) to
release, patch, and distribute a Shorebird app with Android and iOS.

This app was created with `flutter create` and no changes have been made to its
source code, aside from updates to the theme color to validate that patches
were being applied.

See https://docs.shorebird.dev/ci/codemagic/ for a detailed guide.
